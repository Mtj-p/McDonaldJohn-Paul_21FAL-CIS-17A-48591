I would like to apologize for my poor performance this semester. 
I let the time get away from me and I have not demonstrated the extent of my abilities.
Attached is a project with poor representations of the concepts we've learned,
with no conclusive game aspect whatsoever. I attempted to follow your lead with your 
card game lecture, and I got lost in finding the correct way to implement the hands
to actually play the game.
